The given binary tree is as follows:

      A
     / \
    B   C
   / \   \
  D   E   F

Simple as that. We are searching for anykind of node. It could be a leaf - so the last node as "E"
or any node inside a tree like "C".

I am going to write step by step guide how to program is executing this code as "me in future" will
understand it correctly!
